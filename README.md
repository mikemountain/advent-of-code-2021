# Advent of Code 2021

Committing all my Advent of Code 2021 solutions, whether or not I'm particularly proud of the solution.

### Solutions I'm Proud Of

Yeah, I'm rolling with that title. Days where I feel I came up with a pretty solid solution.

- Day 3
- Day 4
- Day 6
- Day 7

### Solutions I'm Not Proud Of

Days where my solution felt really hacky, janky, or that there must have been a much more clever solution that I couldn't find.

- Day 8
- Day 9 (I did end up figuring out a bit more of a pythonic way (maybe?) to loop through the neighbours for pt 2, but left pt 1 for shame)
- Day 11 (structured really messily, I could clean it up I'm sure)
